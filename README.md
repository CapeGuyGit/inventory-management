# inventory-management

its a cheap inventory management with csv file
you can call it wallmart version of inventory management but its great

it adds a product to your inventory
if you want to search it you get a random serial number you can type that in the category and it'll get you the
thing you want, if its not in the file then it'll slam the project with [exit code 0] in your face

hope this helps to someone
 
:D
