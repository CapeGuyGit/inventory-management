# inventory-management

its a cheap inventory management with csv file
you can call it wallmart version of inventory management but its great

it adds a product to your invemtory
if you want to search it you get a random serial number you can type that in and it'll get you the
thing you want, if ts not in the file then it'll slam the project in your face

hope this helps to someone
 
:D
